# README

Welcome to our app, Whack! Whack was created as a way for us to exercise our Ruby on Rails skills. BarretteBanner and Emi1yM created this app in a week at the conclusion of module three (which focused on Ruby on Rails) of Flatiron School's immersive software engineering program. We chose to try to mimic the app Slack to see how close we could get. It's not quite the same... a little... whack, you might say. ;)

# How to Open Whack
After changing directory through your terminal into the folder 'slackapp', run 'rails server'. In your browser, go to the address 

http://localhost:3000/base/home

to get started. From there you can create an account, log in, create channels, message other users in those channels, and direct message (dm) specific users.

We experimented with Bootstrap and creating our own styles using css, so you'll see some differences in design throughout the app.

Our app also has an analytics page, at 

http://localhost:3000/base/analytics

Enjoy!
